This is a mini python project which makes use of BeautifulSoap and Selenium in order to automate the job of Data Entry to forms.

In order to successfully run the project, you need the following:

1.) A google form with the following fields:
    Address of Property, Price of Property and Link to property post
    The Google form can be created by going on the following link:
              **https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/**

2.) A custom search link from Zillow (as used by me).
    (Any other site could be used but you will need to change the code according to the search link used)
    A custom search link can be generated from the following link:
		            **https://www.zillow.com/**

# Simple Blog post website

## This is a simple blog-post website built using python, jinja and flask

**( The website uses api calls for the data which contains dummy data )**

In order to run the project, run the main.py file which makes calls to the index.html and post.html according to the routes.

**Note-** The folder structure has to be maintained as such because it is the required structure for flask projects.
